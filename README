TinyBatt - brief one-line battery information
=============================================

    The goal of this software is to display battery information in the
format most useful for inclusion in text-based interfaces (read: my tmux
status line).

    Altough one can achieve this by piping output of any acpi tool through
gnu toolchain, polling such chain has a bigger footprint and I need
something to play with while learning C.
